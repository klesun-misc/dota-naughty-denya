### Denya X-Mas Party

So, our game designer told me approximately this:

You are a team of 5 people. There are 5 gems to decorate a christmas tree scattered across a forest/maze, and a star. Your goal is to collect all 5 gems and the star and place them in the center of the maze. Placed, they become towers that attack Denya.

When you leave base, Denya comes and crushes all your towers, scattering gems around again. Each player can hold just one item at a time, so base whatsoever has to be left for the sixt item. To secure towers from Denya, you have to put some cheese on the road to lure him away.

So, that's the very basi idea. I guess it's enough for now to start coding.


********** ALTERNATIVE IDEA ***********

### Creeps vs Towers X-Mas Defenders

Two teams, each has heroes. Good guys build towers to help them defend the christmas tree while it is "being decorated" (30 minutes or so), they survive - they win. Bad guys spawn creeps to help them defeat good guys, each spawned creep increases their income.

Unlike other "Castle Defense"-type maps, here you can also build towers (i suppose they should be made vital for survival somehow), so you always have to decide, whether spend money on tower or on items.

Unlike other "Tower Wars"-type maps, here each player has a hero, that takes part in the siege/defence and creeps don't ignore towers - they have to first defeat the defenders before they can go further.

### Охотники Reborn

Each player picks a hero, then they go to the dungeon. The goal is to each the end. To fulfill that, players have to defeat creeps on the way, complete some mini-quests, maybe solve some puzzles...
