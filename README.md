### Creeps vs Towers X-Mas Defenders

Two teams, each has heroes. Good guys build towers to help them defend the christmas tree while it is "being decorated" (30 minutes or so), they survive - they win. Bad guys spawn creeps to help them defeat good guys, each spawned creep increases their income.

Unlike other "Castle Defense"-type maps, here you can also build towers (i suppose they should be made vital for survival somehow), so you always have to decide, whether spend money on tower or on items.

Unlike other "Tower Wars"-type maps, here each player has a hero, that takes part in the siege/defence and creeps don't ignore towers - they have to first defeat the defenders before they can go further.
