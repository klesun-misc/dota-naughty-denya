So, our game designer told me approximately this:

You are a team of 5 people. There are 5 gems to decorate a christmas tree scattered across a forest/maze, and a star. Your goal is to collect all 5 gems and the star and place them in the center of the maze. Placed, they become towers that attack Denya.

When you leave base, Denya comes and crushes all your towers, scattering gems around again. Each player can hold just one item at a time, so base whatsoever has to be left for the sixt item. To secure towers from Denya, you have to put some cheese on the road to lure him away.

So, that's the very basi idea. I guess it's enough for now to start coding.
